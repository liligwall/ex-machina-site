                        Programmer Caleb Smith, who works for the dominant search engine company Blue Book,
                        wins an office contest for a
                        one-week visit to the luxurious, isolated home of the CEO, Nathan Bateman. Nathan lives in a modern home next to a
                        waterfall and climbing hills and is alone apart from a servant named Kyoko, who according to Nathan does not speak
                        English. After Caleb arrives, Nathan reveals to him that he has built a female humanoid robot named Ava with artificial
                        intelligence. After asking Caleb if he is familiar with the Turing test, Nathan tells Caleb that he wants him to judge
                        whether Ava is genuinely capable of thought and consciousness despite knowing she is artificial. Furthermore, the test
                        will be passed if Caleb forgets that Ava is not human during their daily sessions.
                        <br><br>
                        Ava has a robotic body but a human-looking face, hands and feet. She is confined to
                        her isolated cell. Caleb is
                        fascinated with Ava, but after trying to discuss Ava's technological design with Nathan, Nathan asks that Caleb only
                        tell him how he "feels" about her. Throughout their talks, Caleb begins to feel attracted to Ava. She seems to
                        reciprocate these feelings, and also expresses a desire to experience the outside world. Ava tells him she can trigger
                        power outages that temporarily shut down the surveillance system that Nathan uses to monitor their interactions,
                        allowing them to speak privately. The power outages also trigger the building's security system to lock all the doors.
                        During one outage, Ava tells Caleb that Nathan is a liar who cannot be trusted.
