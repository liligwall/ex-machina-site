                    An artificial intelligence created by Nathan and housed in a robotic female body, and the subject to be evaluated by
                    Caleb. At first she looks obviously artificial with transparent abdomen, legs, arms, and skull, having only a lifelike
                    face to present the illusion of being human. She was designed to read and make facial expressions, converse, and move
                    naturally, and despite being recently made has the personality of an adult woman. She has never been allowed to leave
                    the room where she is kept, although she has secondhand knowledge of the outside world. Since Caleb is the first person
                    she has met besides Nathan, she takes great interest in him, and soon begins to act like she has romantic feelings for
                    him. However, during a power outage she suddenly tells Caleb not to trust Nathan, and begs him to help her escape. As
                    the tension of the film escalates, there are signs that Ava may have an agenda other than simple escape from captivity.
                    Played by Alicia Vikander

                   <br>
                    An ordinary 26 year old coder working for the world's largest internet company. One day, he is randomly selected as the
                    winner of an exclusive trip to the estate of Nathan, his company's reclusive and brilliant CEO. Upon arriving, he is
                    asked to sign a nondisclosure agreement and given his real assignment: to act as the human participant in a "Turing
                    Test" for Ava, an advanced AI developed by Nathan, and determine if she passes. Caleb is initially awed by Nathan's
                    compound, the charismatic CEO himself, and by Ava's captivating beauty and life-like personality. However, his
                    uneasiness about the compound's tight surveillance, Nathan's desire for control, and Ava's warning not to trust Nathan
                    cause him to begin probing for the truth behind the experiment.

                    The billionaire CEO and inventor of BlueBook, a search engine that accounts for more than 90% of all internet searches.
                    He is notoriously reclusive and lives in an isolated compound that can only be reached by helicopter. Despite his
                    muscular build, casual speech patterns, and weakness for alcohol, he is a world class genius who is inventing something
                    truly extraordinary. After welcoming Caleb into his compound, he introduces him to his creation Ava. Nathan claims to
                    want to test Ava's AI to see if she can really pass as human, and speculates that a revolution in AI could make real
                    humans obsolete if he succeeds. Soon, however, Caleb begins to see that Nathan's brilliance and hospitality are hiding
                    something sinister.
                    Played by Oscar Isaac.
